# MagicLens - Augmented Reality Video Platform

MagicLens is a web-based platform that allows users to add augmented reality overlays to their videos. It features a React-based frontend with Flow blockchain authentication and a distributed backend with three specialized services:

- **Main API Service** (Python/FastAPI) - Core business logic and REST API
- **Logging Server** (Python/FastAPI) - Log aggregation and error reporting  
- **Collaboration Server** (Node.js/Socket.IO) - Real-time WebSocket collaboration

## üîê Authentication Flow

MagicLens uses a hybrid authentication system combining Flow blockchain with JWT tokens:

1. **Flow Wallet Connection** ‚Üí **Signature Request** ‚Üí **Backend Verification** 
2. **JWT Token Generation** ‚Üí **Token Storage** ‚Üí **API Authentication**

## üéØ Key Features

- **Flow Blockchain Authentication** with cryptographic signature verification
- **Video and Asset Management** with PostgreSQL backend
- **Augmented Reality Editor** for overlay positioning
- **Collaboration Workspace** for artists and videographers
- **AI-Powered Recommendations** for smart overlay suggestions
- **üß† Smart Pose Analysis** - AI understands human movement for intelligent AR placement

## üí° Why Users Love MagicLens

### üé¨ For Content Creators & Videographers

**Problem**: Manually positioning AR overlays is time-consuming and often looks unprofessional
**Solution**: Our AI watches your video and automatically suggests the perfect spots for overlays

**Real Examples**:
- **Fitness Videos**: Overlays automatically avoid blocking your form demonstrations
- **Dance Content**: AR effects that follow your choreography without interfering
- **Tutorials**: Graphics appear exactly where they're most helpful
- **Sports Analysis**: Performance data overlays that highlight technique without obstruction

**Before MagicLens**: 30 minutes positioning overlays ‚Üí Often blocking important action
**With MagicLens**: 3 minutes ‚Üí Professional results every time ‚ú®

### üé® For Digital Artists & AR Creators

**Problem**: Creating overlays that work across different videos and poses is nearly impossible
**Solution**: Design once, work everywhere - our pose analysis ensures your art looks great on any content

**Real Examples**:
- **Motion-Reactive Art**: Your creations respond to human movement automatically
- **Pose-Aware Assets**: Design overlays that know whether someone is standing, sitting, or dancing
- **Smart Marketplace**: Users find your assets that perfectly match their content style
- **Quality Assurance**: Never worry about your art being poorly positioned

**Before**: Create static overlays ‚Üí Hope they work ‚Üí Often don't fit well
**With MagicLens**: Create intelligent assets ‚Üí Work perfectly everywhere ‚Üí Higher sales üí∞

### ü§ù For Collaborative Teams

**Problem**: Artists and videographers waste time disagreeing about overlay placement
**Solution**: AI provides objective, data-driven suggestions that both parties can trust

**Real Examples**:
- **Shared Understanding**: Both team members see the same pose analysis
- **Faster Decisions**: AI suggestions eliminate subjective guesswork
- **Professional Results**: Consistent quality across all team projects
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Live pose detection during collaborative editing sessions

**Before**: Hours of back-and-forth ‚Üí Subjective disagreements ‚Üí Delays
**With MagicLens**: Instant AI consensus ‚Üí Data-driven decisions ‚Üí Ship faster üöÄ

- **PREVENT BLOAT** - Audit and consolidate before adding features
- **DRY** - Single source of truth for shared logic
- **CLEAN** - Clear separation of concerns
- **MODULAR** - Composable, testable modules
- **PERFORMANT** - Adaptive loading and caching
- **ORGANIZED** - Predictable file structure
