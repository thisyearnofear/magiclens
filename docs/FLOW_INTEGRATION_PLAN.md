## Technical Architecture

### 1. Flow Blockchain Layer

#### Smart Contracts (Cadence)
```
contracts/
├── ARAssetNFT.cdc          # Main NFT contract for AR overlays
├── CollaborationHub.cdc    # Multi-party collaboration contracts
├── MarketplaceCore.cdc     # Asset trading and licensing
└── ForteAutomation.cdc     # Actions & Workflows integration
```

**ARAssetNFT Features:**
- Mint AR overlays as NFTs (GIF, PNG, MP4)
- Metadata: category, usage rights, royalties
- Composability: combine multiple assets
- Licensing: commercial vs personal use

**CollaborationHub Features:**
- Multi-signature project ownership
- Revenue sharing smart contracts
- Access control for team members
- Automated royalty distribution

#### Flow Forte Integration

**Actions (Reusable Operations):**
- `MintARAsset` - Create new AR overlay NFT
- `ApplyOverlay` - Add AR to video with timestamp
- `ShareRevenue` - Distribute earnings to collaborators
- `LicenseAsset` - Grant usage rights

**Workflows (Automated Sequences):**
- **Scheduled Publishing**: Auto-publish videos at optimal times
- **Collaboration Triggers**: Notify team on milestone completion
- **Royalty Distribution**: Auto-pay creators when assets are used
- **Content Moderation**: Flag inappropriate overlays

### 2. Frontend Integration

#### Flow SDK Setup
```typescript
// app/src/lib/flow/
├── config.ts              # Flow network configuration
├── fcl-config.ts          # FCL (Flow Client Library) setup
├── transactions/          # Transaction templates
│   ├── mint-asset.ts
│   ├── create-collaboration.ts
│   └── apply-overlay.ts
├── scripts/               # Read-only queries
│   ├── get-assets.ts
│   ├── get-user-nfts.ts
│   └── check-ownership.ts
└── hooks/
    ├── use-flow-auth.ts   # Flow wallet connection
    ├── use-nft-assets.ts  # NFT asset management
    └── use-workflows.ts   # Forte workflow triggers
```

#### Wallet Integration
- **Primary**: Flow Wallet (official)
- **Secondary**: Blocto, Lilico
- **Features**: 
  - One-click wallet connection
  - Transaction signing
  - NFT display in wallet

### 3. Backend Integration

#### Flow Service Layer
```python
# services/core/flow/
├── __init__.py
├── flow_client.py         # Flow blockchain client
├── nft_service.py         # NFT minting & management
├── workflow_service.py    # Forte Actions/Workflows
├── marketplace_service.py # Trading & licensing
└── event_listener.py      # Listen to blockchain events
```

**Key Functions:**
- Verify NFT ownership before asset access
- Trigger workflows on backend events
- Sync blockchain state with database
- Handle royalty calculations
