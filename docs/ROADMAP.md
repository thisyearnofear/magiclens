  ```typescript
  // AR Preview Component
  const ARPreviewMode = ({ video, overlays }) => {
    return (
      <a-scene embedded arjs>
        <a-marker preset="hiro">
          {overlays.map(overlay => (
            <a-plane 
              src={overlay.asset_url}
              position={overlay.position}
              animation="property: rotation; to: 0 360 0; loop: true"
            />
          ))}
        </a-marker>
      </a-scene>
    );
  };
  ```

- [ ] **Interactive Positioning**
  - Drag and drop overlays in AR space
  - Real-time position feedback
  - Multi-angle preview capabilities

- [ ] **AR Collaboration Tools**
