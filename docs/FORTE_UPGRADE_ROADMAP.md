# MagicLens Forte Upgrade Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

The Forte network upgrade introduces powerful new capabilities to the Flow blockchain that will significantly enhance MagicLens's AR asset monetization and workflow automation. However, given that AR functionality is the core value proposition, we're implementing a phased approach prioritizing AR reliability before advanced blockchain features.

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Current)**: AR Functionality Refinement
  - Complete reliable AR overlay positioning, rendering, and real-time collaboration

- **Phase 2 (October 2025)**: Forte Mainnet Preparation
  - Pre-mainnet preparation as Forte goes live on mainnet (October 22, 2025)
  - Update contract addresses and configurations

- **Phase 3 (Q4 2025 / Q1 2026)**: Forte Features Implementation
  - Implement Flow Actions for AR asset composability
  - Add scheduled royalty distributions
  - Integrate WebAuthn authentication
  - Launch high-precision financial calculations

## Feature Priorities

### Phase 3A: Scheduled Transactions & Royalties
- Implement automated royalty distributions for AR assets
- Create time-based workflow triggers for content publishing
- Enable scheduled collaboration notifications and milestone checks

### Phase 3B: Flow Actions Integration
- Create AR Asset Sources for revenue generation from usage
- Implement AR Asset Sinks for revenue distribution to collaborators
- Build Swappers for AR asset trading marketplace
- Add Price Oracles for AR asset valuation

### Phase 3C: Enhanced User Experience
- Implement WebAuthn passkey authentication
- Add high-precision UFix128 calculations for royalties
- Create atomic collaboration workflows using Flow Actions

### Phase 3D: Advanced Automation
- Composable AR asset licensing workflows
- Automated revenue sharing based on usage metrics
- Cross-platform asset monetization tools

## Technical Requirements

### Pre-Forte Implementation
- All AR functionality must be stable and reliable
- Video processing pipeline optimized for performance
- Real-time collaboration features working seamlessly
- User interface polished and responsive

### Forte Integration Prerequisites
- Updated contract addresses for mainnet deployment
- WebAuthn authentication flow implementation
- UFix128 precision data structures in smart contracts
- Flow Actions connector configurations

## Risk Mitigation

- Continue using current Flow blockchain features during AR development
- Maintain compatibility with existing user base and workflows
- Implement Forte features as enhancements rather than replacements
- Test all new features thoroughly before rollout

## Success Metrics

### AR Functionality
- 95%+ success rate for AR overlay placement
- <2 second latency for real-time collaboration
- 99% uptime for core AR services

### Forte Integration
- 100% of scheduled transactions executing reliably
- <1% slippage in AR asset trading
- 90%+ user adoption of WebAuthn features
- 50%+ reduction in transaction fees due to sub-cent costs

## Documentation Updates

This roadmap supersedes any previous Forte integration plans and establishes the phased approach prioritizing AR core functionality before advanced blockchain features.
